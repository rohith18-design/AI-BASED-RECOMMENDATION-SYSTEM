HOW IT WORKS

DataModel: Loads user-item ratings from CSV.

Similarity Calculation: Measures similarity between users using Pearson correlation.

Neighborhood Formation: Finds top N (e.g., 2) most similar users.

Recommendation Generation: Suggests items liked by similar users but not yet rated by the target user.

LEARNING OUTCOMES

PROJECT SUMMARY (for report)

This project demonstrates a recommendation system built in Java using Apache Mahout.
It reads user-product rating data from a CSV file and predicts product preferences using user-based collaborative filtering.
The system calculates similarity between users, finds nearest neighbors, and recommends items that similar users liked but the target user hasn’t seen yet.
The implementation showcases real-world recommendation principles used in e-commerce and media platforms.
